    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>
      Easy, American-style, fluffy pancakes are great for feeding a crowd at
      breakfast or brunch. Top with something sweet like fruit, jam or syrup, or
      rashers of crispy bacon.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>200g self-raising flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>25g melted butter, plus extra for cooking</li>
      <li>200ml milk</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil, for cooking</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix 200g self-raising flour, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp golden caster
        sugar and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a well in the centre with the back of your spoon then add 3 large
        eggs, 25g melted butter and 200ml milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together either with a balloon whisk or electric hand beaters
        until smooth then pour into a jug.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a small knob of butter and 1 tsp of oil in a large, non-stick
        frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter looks frothy, pour in
        rounds of the batter, approximately 8cm wide. Make sure you don’t put
        the pancakes too close together as they will spread during cooking. Cook
        the pancakes on one side for about 1-2 mins or until lots of tiny
        bubbles start to appear and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes over
        and cook for a further minute on the other side. Repeat until all the
        batter is used up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve your pancakes stacked up on a plate with a drizzle of maple syrup
        and any of your favourite toppings.
