    <h2>Decription</h2>
    <p>
      Karaage chicken is essentially a Japanese cooking technique where meat
      (usually chicken) is deep fried. The meat is traditionally fried in potato
      starch, but cornstarch and flour are also sometimes used.

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine soy sauce, sake, oil, ginger, and garlic in a bowl and whisk to
        combine. Add chicken pieces and mix well with the marinade. Marinate at
        room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes.

      <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        flour-cornstarch mixture.

      <li>
        Fry chicken pieces in batches until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
        Remove from the hot oil, transfer to a wire rack, and allow to rest for
        3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase heat until oil is 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry chicken
        pieces for another 1 to 2 minutes in the hot oil until very crisp.
